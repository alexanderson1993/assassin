	<h2>Shank You</h2>
	<p>Shank You is a live-action game based off of Assassin. The objective: eliminate your target; stay alive.</p>

	<p>Several players (more than 5 is best) join the game. The app takes their contact info and assigns each player a target from the pool of the players in the game. Players must then track down and eliminate their target. The elimination method is specified for each game. Possible elimination options include photographing the target, gently prodding with a spoon, or planting a device, like an alarm or rubber snake, which eliminates players when found or activated.</p>

	<h4>Instructions</h4>
