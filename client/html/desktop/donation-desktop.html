		<h2>Hi there!</h2>
		<p>I've put together this game and host it out of the goodness of my heart - and my own pocket. Feel free to try it out for as long as you want, but if you think it's awesome, consider donating to help me pay for it's continued operation.</p>
		<p>The suggested price is $5 per new game.</p>
